# MyCTFChallenge
A random repository for homemade CTF challenge. Use it at your own risk

These are the challenge inspired by inapplicable ideas that I had while solving for another challenge. These ideas might be useless when the CTF takes place, but it might worth for another challenge. Cuz why not ??

Most of the challenge you found here is Crypto (because I only know crypto at the moment). Hopefully there will be more categories in the futures. 

| Challenge | Category | Tag | Difficulty | 
| ---       | ---      | --- | ----       |
|Weird Generator| Crypto | RSA, math | 1/10
